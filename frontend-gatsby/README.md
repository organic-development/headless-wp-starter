# Gatsby / Wordpress / GraphQL Theme

Adapted from [this tutorial](https://dev.to/nevernull/overview-guide-to-gatsby-wordpress-starter-advanced-with-previews-i18n-and-more-583l).
Uses GraphQL to query Wordpress directly, which works better than using the `gatsby-wordpress-source` plugin.

## Known Issues

- `isFrontPage` attribute not found in `./src/templates/page/data.js`
